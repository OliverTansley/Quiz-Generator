--
what are MIPS
-
Millions of Instructions Per Second
--
What does the performance of a parrallel system depend on
-
Degree of parrallelism,Interconnection structure,main memory architecture, degree of instruction parrallelism
--
what are FLOPS
-
Floating point Operations Per Second
--
why is the maximum performance of n processors with p performance never achieved
-
Non highly parrallel algorithms, Inter processors communication delays
--
what is speedup
-
speed before change/speed after change
--
how do you calculate processor utilisation/efficiency
-
speedup/number of cores
--
What is a programs degree of parrallelism
-
The number of cores which allow the program to reach its maximum speedup and efficiency or maximum level of parrallelism that can be exploited by the program 
--
What is the average throughput of a program with both vector and scalar operations
-
1/b = f/b_s + (1-f)/b_v
--
what is the execution time for 1 N component vector operation
-
T_v = N/b_v
--
what is the execution time for 1 scalar operation
-
T_s = 1/b_s
--
Assuming T_v = T_0 + (NT_s)/n what is the average throughput
-
ignore T_0 when N is large
FINISH CARD

what is amdahls law
-
speedup = n/(1 + (n-1)f)
