--
what are the two main uses of structural designs
-
A way of facilitating discussion about the system design with stakeholders.
A way of documenting an architecture that has been designed.
--
what kind of Requirements inform the structure of the system
-
Non-functional Requirements
--
what factors should be considered during system architecture design
-
performance,security,saftey,availability,maintainability
--
what is an architectural pattern
-
a way to represent and share common knowledge
--
what are the different architectural patterns
-
layered,Repository,Pipe and filter,Model view controller
--
what are the advantages to a layered architecture
-
Layers can be assigned to different members of the development team
Can replace layers with different implementations at a later date
Can easily develop multi-platform implementations through swapping layers
Can add redundant facilities, such as authentication to each layer to increase dependability
--
what are the disadvantages of a layered architecture
-
Separation of functionality like this can be hard, and requires you to trust your developers
--
what are the advantages of a Repository architecture
-
Components can be independent,All data can be managed consistently
as it is stored in the same place,Changes made by one component
can be easily propagated to all components,Efficient means of sharing large
amounts of data.
--
what are the disadvantages of a Repository based architecture
-
Single point of failure,Inefficient due to having all requests
go through repository,Distributing repository to scale up
may be difficult as we need to keep consistency,Have to enforce standardised
approaches and data models, makes evolution difficult.
--
what is the advantages of a pipe and filter system
-
Easy to understand and evolve - adding new transformations is easy,
Matches the structure of many applications,Supports reuse - components are just
transformations so can be easily ported,Flexible, as it can be a sequential or a
concurrent system
--
what are the disadvantages of a pipe and filter system
-
Standardised data format required,Each component must stick to a
rigorous standard which makes modification difficult,If your input updates / changes the
system may need to be heavily edited,Canâ€™t be used to graphical interfaces
--
what are the advantages of model-view-controller architecture
-
Separates components of implementation, in particular user-facing components,
Data can be changed independently of how it is displayed,
Allows user to have control over how they see the data - without changing the underlying data model
Changing data in one representation can be propagated to other representations
--
what are the disadvantages of model-view-controller architecture
-
Introduces additional complexity to design,
Even simple interactions require considering the three different aspects of the system,
Can be difficult to distribute development,
Portability is low due to the heavy interaction between all three components of the system.
