--
how does version control Software help with Release Management
-
Mitigates human error - user commits erroneous code at last minute,
Mitigates technical error - laptop/server dies/gets stolen,
--
what three environments typically exist for Software Development
-
master,Development, and feature
--
what is system building
-
the final linking together of all components of the code base
--
what kind of features can we expect from build tools
-
Build Script Generation,Version Control System Integration,Minimal Recompilation,Executable System Creation,Test Automation,Reporting,Documentation Generation
--
what platforms do we have to consider when building a system
-
The Development System,The Build Server,The Target Environment
--
why do we continually integrate our system in agile Methodologies
-
Building becomes cheaper as only small changes are committed each time
--
why does continous Integration not always work
-
Big systems may take hours to build,If the development environment is very different to the target
environment
--
what are the two different catagories of data our systems will deal with
-
dummy/stub data, real/production data
--
what things need to be checked during the transition from dummy to real data
-
Availability of data sources,Constraints around data acquisition,Additional overheard of data processing,Long-term storage/backups/archives,Data sharing/access constraints.
--
what checks should be made regarding release Management
-
Dependencies should be explicit and recorded,Physical distribution should be hidden (and not hardwired)
and via multiple channels,The release process should require minimal effort on the
part of the developer and client,The scope of the release (to whom) should be controllable
(also useful to record downloads),Sufficient descriptive information should be available,Interdependent systems should be retrievable as a group,
Unnecessary retrievals should be avoided,A history should be kept (release log)
--
what factors need to be considered when making changes to a built system
-
The consequences of not implementing the change,The benefits of change,The number of users affected by the change,The costs of making the change,The product release cycle
