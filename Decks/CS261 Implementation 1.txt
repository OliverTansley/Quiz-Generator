--
what are design patterns
-
shorthand for describing aspects of program Organisation
--
what are some examples of a design pattern
-
encapsulation,subclasses,iteration,exceptions
--
what are creational patterns
-
design patterns that deal with the creation of new objects in our code.
--
what is a factory
-
an object which handles the production of complex objects, to avoid repeating code many times over
--
what are the advantages to factories
-
cutting down on repeated code,
Adding new variations and scenarios is easier,
Good testability,
--
what are the disadvantages to factories
-
We have to make a lot of additional classes,
The factory is linked to the class it produces, if we extend the class being produced, we need to also update / extend the factories.
--
what are builders
-
objects that construct objects made out of components that have a variety of different options
--
what are the advantages of builders
-
More control over construction,Can re-use construction code for different instances,Single responsibility principle - only one place has to
deal with the complex construction of an object
--
what are the disadvantages of builders
-
requires a large number of new classes,
Code becomes longer, construction is still complex just more modular
--
what is a prototype
-
an object which has the ability to clone itself completeley
--
what are the advantages of prototypes
-
Donâ€™t need to make another subclass just to create an object,
Remove heavy initialisation in favour of cloning,
Can produce complex objects easily,
Can keep class hierarchy simple,
--
what are the disadvantages of prototypes
-
Circular references can be tricky (one object points to another, which points back to it)
Might still have to perform heavy changes and updates on the cloned object
