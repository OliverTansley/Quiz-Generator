--
what is a software Methodology
-
The systematic analysis of methods applied to software Development
--
what are the two different prcoess model catagories
-
Plan-driven and agile
--
what are the features of plan driven Development
-
all of the process activities are planned in advanced
progress measured against the initial plan
(nearly) fixed specification before Development commences
--
what are the features of agile Development
-
incremental planning
more adaptable to change during Development
--
what are the stages of the waterfall model
-
requirements analysis
system design 
implementation and unit testing 
integration and system testing 
operation and maintainance
--
what happens in requirements analysis
-
systems services, constraints, and goals are established
--
what happens in system design
-
identification of the software components and their relationships
--
what happens implementation and unit testing
-
software is programmed in components or unitsm and each unit is tested against its specification
--
what happens in integration and system testing
-
software components are integrated and tested together as a complete system to ensure that the requirements have been met
--
what happens in operation and maintainance
-
the system is intstalled to fulfil its purpose, errors that appear later are fixed. System services enhanced as new requirements are discovered
--
when does the waterfall method work
-
if the requirements are understood and will not change during Development
there are few team constraints (size,location)
each component can be individually tested against its own spec before integration
its easy to add members to the team (good documentation)
--
when doesnt the waterfall method work
-
customer has to wait a long time before seeing results
it is difficult to accomodate change once the process starts
difficult to respond to changing customer requirements
--
what problems occur if a waterfall project runs for a long time
-
business priorities change
customer expectations change
underlying technologies change
--
what is incremental Development
-
when software is Developed in stages, with interleaved customer feedback Each stage is planned in full and validated against the plan
before the iteration is considered complete
--
what are the advantages of incremental Development
-
Cost of accommodating changing customer requirements is reduced
Software available to user quicker, and therefore feedback can be easily solicited
Greater perceived value for money - customers can see development progress
Include the user in acceptance testing at each phase.
--
what are the disadvantages of incremental development
-
Difficult to estimate the cost of development
Difficult to maintain consistency with new features being added - poor design choices at the beginning may hinder later development
As progress continues, it becomes harder to include new features or make changes to fundamental components
Not cost-effective to produce documentation for every version of the software
Increased cost of repeated deployment
--
what is reuse oriented software engineering
-
when development of a product relies on a large base of reusable components
--
what are the stages of reuse-oriented development
-
Component analysis - searching for available components to meet the specification
requirements modification - analyse the found components to determine if they meet the requirements, modifying requirements if acceptable to do so
system design with re-use - desing the system using the components
development and integration - integrate the selected components into a complete system
--
what is the first prcoess of a software Methodology 
-
software specification
--
what are the stages of requirements engineering
-
Feasability study 
requirements elicitation and analysis
requirements specification
requirements validation
--
what does the Feasability study do 
-
determine that the task is Feasable and cost effective
--
what does the requirements elecitation and analysis stage do
-
derive the system requirements by looking at existing documentation, talking to customers, discussion of features possibly involving a prototype development
--
what does the requirements specification stage do
-
translates information gathered in elicitation phase into formal documents that define the set of requirements
--
what does the requirements validation stage do
-
ensures the requirements are achieveable and valid
(you then ensure the customer signs off on these requirements)
