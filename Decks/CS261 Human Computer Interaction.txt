--
what two things do we need to consider when designing UIs
-
Memory, and attention
--
what are the four different types of attention
-
selective: tuning things out to focus on others,
sustained: 'attention span',
divided: multitasking,
executive: more organised version of sustained
--
how can we keep users attention in UI design
-
don’t clog the UI,Switch up your visuals,Make it intuitive,Use attention grabbing techniques sparring
--
how can we manipulate attention in UI
-
guide the user’s attention to the part of the display most relevant,
grab the user’s attention away from their current task when required,
metaphors enable recognition even in new systems (drag and drop),
--
what are the three components of Memory
-
sensory stores: information stored before in working memory,
Working Memory: Holds transitory information and makes it available for further information processing,
Long-term Memory: Holds information for long term storage,
--
what is short term memory
-
a scratchpad for temporary recall of the information under processes
--
what are the theories around forgetting short term memory
-
Decay Theory: Memory decays over time,
Displacement Theory: New memory overwrites the old memory,
Proactive Interference: Memory cannot be retrieved because it is stored in the wrong place
--
what are the two kinds of long term memory
-
Episodic Memory, and Semantic Memory
--
what kind of memory should we design UIs for
-
short term memory
--
why is short term memory best for UIs
-
more effort is expended commiting and retrieving from long term memory
--
what is normans human action cycle
-
the stages which humans go through when interacting with a computer system
--
what are the stages of the human action cycle
-
form a goal,intention to act,planning to act,execution,feedback,interpret feedback,evaluate outcome
--
what aspects of the cycle are used to evaluate UIs
-
the gulf of evaluation, the gulf of execution
--
what is the gulf of evaluation
-
the cognitive gap which must be crossed to interpret a UI
--
what is the gulf of execution
-
the gap between the users goals and the means to execute those goals
--
what principles can we extract from the use of the cycle
-
provide visibility,provide a good conceptual model,provide good mappings,provide feedback
--
what principles can be derived from Gestalt laws of perceptual organisation
-
the figure ground principle,the similarity principle,the proximity principle,the common region principle,the continuity principle,the closure principle, the focal point principle
--
what is the foreground principle
-
people segment their vision into the figure and foreground
--
what is the similarity principle
-
if things look similar we assume similar functionality
--
what is the proximity principle
-
if objects are close together we assume they are related
--
what is the common region principle
-
we group objects together that are in the same close region (borders)
--
what is the continuity principle
-
if we put objects in a line or curve we assume they are related
--
what is the closure principle
-
if we see a complex arrangement of shapes, we are likely to form them into a pattern
--
what is the focal point principle
-
you will be drawn to the most unique object
--
what is perception
-
knowledge that is detected rather than constructed
--
what are affordances
-
what an object allows us to do
--
what are signifiers
-
hints/cues as to what affordances an object has
--
what are nelsons usability principles
-
Visibility of system status,Match between system and real-world,User control and freedom,Consistency and standards,Help users recognise and recover from errors,
Error prevention,Recognition rather than recall,Flexibility and efficiency of use,Aesthetic and minimalist design,Help and documentation.
