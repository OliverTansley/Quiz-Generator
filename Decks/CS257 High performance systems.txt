--
what are symmetric multiprocessors
-
Two or more similar processors of comparable capacity, and which share memory
--
what are the advantages to using SMP
-
performance boost, greater availability, incremental scaling
--
what is a cluster
-
independant computers capable of collaborating on a problem as if they were one machine
--
what is cluster middleware
-
a Software layer that provides a unified system image to the user
--
what services/functions are desireable from cluster middleware
-
Single entry point,
Single file hierarchy,
Single virtual networking,
Single memory space,
Single job-management system,
Single user interface,
Single I/O space,
Single process space,
Check-pointing: A function periodically saves the process state and the intermediate
computing results, to allow rollback recovery after a failure,
Process migration: This function enables load balancing,
--
what are the advantages of smps over clusters
-
The SMP approach is easier to manage and configure; much closer to the original single-processor
model for which the application was written,SMPs also take up less space and consume less power
--
what are the advantages of clusters over smps
-
clusters dominate the high-performance server market,Far superior to SMPs in terms of incremental and absolute scalability, and in terms of availability
--
what are the alternatives to SMPs and clusters
-
Uniform Memory Access: multiprocessor Organisation where all memory access times are equal (really a SMP Organisation),
Non-Uniform Memory Access: multiprocessor where all memory accesses are different times deterministically,
Cache-coherent NUMA (CC-NUMA): A NUMA system in which cache coherence is maintained
among the caches of the various processors,
--
what is the objective of cache coherent NUMA
-
to maintain a transparent system-wide memory while permitting multiple multiprocessor nodes, each with its own bus or internal interconnect system.
--
what are the pros of cache coherent NUMA 
-
can deliver effective performance at higher levels of parallelism than SMP without requiring major software changes,
Bus traffic on any individual node is limited to a demand that the bus can handle,
--
what are the cons of cache coherent NUMA
-
If many of the memory accesses are to remote nodes, performance begins to break down,
Does not transparently look like an SMP,
Software changes will be required to move an operating system and applications from an SMP to
a CC-NUMA system,
reliance on interconnect network
