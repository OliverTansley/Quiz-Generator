--
what are MIPS
-
millions of instructions per second
--
what is multithreading
-
(conceptually) dividing the instruction stream into smaller streams known as threads
--
what is explicit multithreading
-
Concurrently execute instructions from explicitly different threads by interleaving instructions on shared pipelines or parallel execution on parallel
pipelines
--
what is implicit multithreading
-
the concurrent execution of multiple threads extracted from a single sequential program
--
what are the approaches to explicit multithreading
-
interleaved (swap after each cycle),blocked (swap at a delay),simultaneous multithreading (Superscalar processor),chip multiprocessing (entire cpu is replicated on a single chip)
--
which methods actually execute threads Concurrently
-
simultaneous multithreading and chip multiprocessing
--
what is a multicore system
-
when all the resources of a processor (core) are replicated on one peice of silicon (die)
--
what are some of the factors motivating multicore systems
-
limitations in: transistor density, power consumption, and frequency. 
--
what is pollacks rule
-
performance increase is roughly proportional to the square root of increase in complexity
--
what are the main three variables of multicore Organisation
-
number of cores on chip, number of levels in cache memory, amount of cache memory shared
--
what are the advantages of having shared L2 cache in multicore systems
-
when multiple threads want to get a new value from main memory its only loaded into L2 once, data isnt replicated as much,good replacement algorithms can dynamically provide more cache
to less tomporally local threads, interprocessor communication is easily implemented using shared memory
--
what is a cluster
-
a group of interconnected whole computers working together as a unified computing resource that can create the illusion of being one machine
--
what are the benefits of clusters
-
absolute scalability,incremental scalability,high availability,superior price/performance
--
what is Uninform memory access
-
All processors have access to all parts of main memory using loads and stores,
Access time to all regions of memory is the same,
Access time to memory for different processors is the same
--
what is non-Uninform memory access
-
All processors have access to all parts of main memory using loads and stores,
Access time of processor differs depending on which region of main memory is being accessed,
Different processors access different regions of memory at different speeds,
--
what are the motivations for NUMA
-
There are limits to the number of cores that can be put together,
Architecture dependant
