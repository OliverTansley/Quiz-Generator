--
what are the two kinds of UML diagram
-
Structure diagram, and Behaviour diagram
--
what is the difference between a state diagram, and an activity diagram
-
state diagrams perform actions in response to events, activity diagrams complete a sequence of actions automatically.
state diagrams show the current state of the system within each node
--
what does a context model do
-
shows the context with which a system will work in, i.e. other systems external to the system
--
why is it important to write correct UML 
-
to ensure ambiguities present are resolved for later implementation
--
what are the features of writing correct UML class diagrams
-
class names (italic for abstract classes <<interface>> prefix for interfaces).
attributes, optional to include datatypes.
methods (not getters,setters, or inherited methods).
attributes (with correct symbol, static ones should be underlined).
comments and association arcs
--
what are the symbols for attributes in a UML class diagram 
-
+,public. -,private. #,protected. ~,package. /,derived.
--
what are the different features of arcs in UML class diagrams
-
multiplicity, (1-1 1-many).
association, (aggregation,composition,dependancy).
class hierarchy (parent class, interface,abstract class).
--
what does aggregation mean
-
is part of
--
what does composition mean
-
is made up of
--
what does dependancy mean
-
uses temporarily
--
what are the main features of writing correct sequence diagrams
-
time moves down the diagram, processes/objects
