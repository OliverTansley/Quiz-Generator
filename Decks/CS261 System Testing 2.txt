--
what are the differnt granularities of testing
-
unit testing, component testing,system testing
--
what is a mock object
-
an instance of a class we require for unit testing
--
what kinds of errors occur at a component/interface level
-
Interface Misuse: one unit doesnt pass the right params,
Interface Misunderstanding: one interface doesnt understand the behavior of another and uses it incorrectly,
Timing Errors: timning constraints arent met due to other interfaces,
--
what are the key differences between system and component testing
-
We may introduce off the shelf / prebuilt components not made by our team by needed for the final system,
Components from all teams will be included - we’re making as complete a system as possible
--
what is use case testing
-
testing a particular peice of functionality that will be required by users of the system
--
what is test driven Development
-
tests are developed for an increment of code, Development doesnt progress until all these tests are working
--
what are the advantages to test driven Development
-
clarify what the code segment is supposed to do,
requires a strong understanding of the functionality to be added,
this then makes it easier to implement the actual functionality, as there is a good understanding
--
what are the disadvantages to test driven Development
-
If you don’t know enough to write the tests, you can’t develop the required code,
You may forget to check important scenarios (such as division by zero), impacting the effectiveness of your testing,
--
when shouldnt test driven Development be used
-
when a system is being refactored, when external components are being used,when the system is mulithreaded (inconsistent results)
--
what are the types of user testing
-
alpha testing beta testing and acceptance testing
--
what is the differences between alpha and beta testing
-
alpha testing happens during development, whereas beta builds are nearly complete,
beta testing uses a larger group
--
what are the stages of acceptance testing
-
Define acceptance criteria,Plan acceptance testing,derive acceptance tests,acceptance tests,negotiate test results,accept or reject the system
--
when is acceptance criteria defined
-
before initial contract is signed
--
what is done during acceptance testing planning
-
establish resources needed and schedule testing,define the requirements coverage and the order of testing
--
what is conditional accceptance
-
the customer accepts the product assuming certain issues will be resolved
