what is agile software development
-
a principle that defines a set of Methodologies
--
what is the main concept of agile development
-
rapid software development
specification design and implementation are interleaved
system is Developed as a series of versions with stakeholders providing feedback at each stage
--
what is the motivation behind agile development
-
software within businesses expect to be able to evolve rapidly, process driven approaches are too cumbersome we need to focus on the code as opposed to the design
--
what are the principles of agile Methodologies
-
customer involvement
Incremental delivery
People not process
Embrace change
Maintain simplicity
--
what is the main disadvantage of agile development
-
as less time is spent writing good documentation, it is harder for a maintainance team to upkeep the product
works best when the maintainance team is the same team as the development team
--
what are the two agile Methodologies
-
extreme programming, scrum
--
name the stages and time periods of extreme programming
-
code
pair programming: seconds
unit testing:minutes
pair negotiation:hours
stand up meeting:one day
acceptance test: days
iteration plan:weeks
release plan:months
--
name some other features of extreme programming
-
sustainable pace
on site customer
collective ownership (paired programming)
constant refactoring
--
what are the three stages of scrum development
-
outline planning phase - establish general goals
sprint cycles - each cycle develops an increment of the system
project closure - wrap up the project, documents and deliverables
--
what are the features of a scrum sprint
-
typically 2-4 weeks
daily team meetings to discuss current work
each sprint completes item on the backlog
features selected with the customer rather than isolated from the customer for the remainder of the cycle
scrum master interfaces between team and customer
at the end of each sprint work is reviewed and presented
--
what are the differences between a prototype and a mvp
-
a prototype is discarded after testing and will include features that may not be considered for the MVP.
the MVP is the 1st version of a complete solution and may be sold to early adopters
