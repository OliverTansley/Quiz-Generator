--
why might a project fail
-
poor Requirements, deadline was unrealistic,insufficient budget,poor comunication between Team and customer,inadequete testing,team members did not fulfil their tasks
--
what are the four main goals of project Management
-
Deliver the software at the agreed time, keep costs within budget,deliver software that meets expectations,maintain a happy well functioning development team
--
what does the succes of a team depend on
-
the people in the team,the group organisation,technical and managerial communication
--
what are the four factors of people management
-
Consistency,respect,inclusion,honesty
--
what are the typical roles of a project team
-
project manager,business analyst,software architect,designer,software developer,software tester
--
what are the two different types of group organisation
-
informal, group decisions are made by a consensus.
hierarchical groups, have a leader and levels of management.
--
what are the benefits to a cohesive group
-
establish your own quality standards,individuals learn from/support eachother,
Knowledge is shared,Refactoring and continual improvement is encouraged.
--
what are the stages to risk management
-
risk identification,risk anaylsis,risk planning,risk monitoring.
--
what kind of risks can be identified in a SE project
-
staff turnover, management change,hardware unavailable,specification delays,Requirements change,size underestimate,tool underperformance,technology change business,product competition.
--
what are the three groups of risk
-
product,project,business risks
--
what are different types of risk
-
technology risks,people risks,organisational risks,Requirements risks,estimation risks,tool risks
--
what happens in risk anaylsis
-
each risk is considered and judged by severity
--
what happens in risk planning
-
plans are considered for the avoidance,minimistation and contingency of each risk
--
what is risk monitoring
-
throughout production the risks probability of occuring are checked to ensure problems are caught early
--
what is a risk register
-
a collection of all risks and their important details
--
what are the stages to project planning
-
propose the project having some idea of how it will be completed,
plan who will work on the project and how it will be decomposed,
periodically plan the project during development when problems/changes occur
-- 
what are the stages to project planning
-
identify activities and seperate tasks planning when they will be done
reduce dependancy between tasks so people dont wait for eachother
estimate the time and resources for each activity
allocate people to these activities and create project charts
--
what is a Gantt chart
-
shows tasks listed vertically against time
--
what is an activity network
-
shows the tasks and their relationships with eachother including their duration
--
what is total float in an activity network node
-
the amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying project finish date
--
what are the two methods of estimating the complexity of software
-
Experienced-based: uses past experience of projects to give an idea of how this one compares and base estimations on this.
Algorithmic cost-based: uses fixed algorithms to calculate an estimate of complexity and cost.
--
how can we measure the success of a project
-
how does it meet the customer Requirements
how does it meet the original specification
