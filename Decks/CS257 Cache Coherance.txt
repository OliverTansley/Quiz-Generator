--
why is a simple write through policy not enough to ensure cohernace in distributed PE's
-
the write through policy will only update main memory
--
what are the possible cache cohernace solutions
-
Shared caches,Non-cachable items,Broadcast write mechanism,Snoop(y) bus mechanism,Directory methods,MESI protocol
--
describe Broadcast write
-
every cache write request sent to all other caches, copies in other caches are either over written or declared invalid
--
what are the disadvantages of Broadcast write 
-
increased memory transactions, waste of bandwidth
--
describe snoop busses
-
a connection made to the system bus from each cache controller which detects if a write signal is being made and will invalidate or overwrite
copies of the modified data
--
what are Directory methods
-
IDK REVISE AGAIN LOL
--
what does mesi stand for
-
modified,Exclusive,Shared,invalid
--
what does modified mean
-
the cache block is not consistent with main memory, and will eventually be written to main memmory when next needed
--
what does Exclusive mean
-
the cache block only exists within one cache
--
what does shared mean
-
the cache block exists in multiple caches and is consistent
--
what does invalid mean
-
the cache block is not consistent and has been discareded
