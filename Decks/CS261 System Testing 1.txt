--
what does testing do 
-
shows a program does what it is meant to do
--
what is Verification
-
testing if the product meets its specification
--
what is validation
-
testing if the product meets the needs of the customer
--
what is an error
-
a human action that produces an incorrect result
--
what is a failure
-
deviation of Software from its expected result
--
what is a bug
-
a manifestation of errors in Software
--
what is testing
-
the process of excersizing Software to see if it meets its Requirements
--
what is a test case
-
a set of inputs preconditions and expected outcomes to test a specific Requirement
--
what is reliability
-
the probability that Software will not cause the failure of system
--
what is a test plan
-
a record of the application of test cases
--
what are the different kinds of testing
-
static and dynamic
--
what is static testing
-
testing without execution: code review,walkthroughs and inspection
--
why do we do static testing
-
allows attributes other than correctness to be studied,
Errors hide other errors,Code does not need to be complete,
Allows us to consider quality too
--
why do we do dynamic testing
-
inspection is bad at discovering, Unexpected interactions between
different components,Timing based issues,System performance issues
--
what is dynamic testing
-
executing code with specific test cases
--
what are the two kinds of dynamic testing
-
Structural and functional
--
what is Structural testing
-
test cases derived from the control flow of the system
--
what is functional testing
-
test cases derived from the formal component specification
--
what are the steps to dynamic functional testing
-
The identification of functions that the software is expected to perform,
The creation of input data based on the function’s specifications,
The determination of output based on the function’s specifications,
The execution of the test case,
The comparison of actual and expected outputs,
check whether the application works as per the customer’s needs
--
what are the different granularity levels of testing
-
unit testing, integration testing,system testing,regressions testing
--
what kinds of values should be used for testing
-
valid,invalid,boundary,extreme
