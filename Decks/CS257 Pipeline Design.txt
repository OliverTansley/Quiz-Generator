What features of pipelines make them difficult to Design and optimise
-
feedback, unequal clock stages
--
what affect does feedback and unequal clock stages have on pipelines
-
initiations may not always be accepted at the start of a pipeline, as collisions could occur
--
describe a reservation table
-
grid of stages against discrete time, where x's mark occupation of stages at those discrete intervals
--
what indicates collisions in a reservation table
-
the distance between two occupied timeslots in the same stage
--
what is a collision vector
-
a binary value that shows us after how many stages there will be a col(C_0 = 1 always).
e.g. if a collision occurs if an initiation occurs after 3 and 5 cycles from the previous initiation then C = 101001
--
what is the initial collision vector
-
the state of the pipleine after the first initiation
--
what is latency
-
the clock cycles between 2 pipeline initiations
--
what is average latency
-
the average number of clock cycles between initiations over some repeating cycle
--
what is minimum average latency
-
the smallest possible latency considering all possible sequences of initiations (the goal for optimum design)
--
what is a pipeline state diagram
-
diagram of linked pipline states, identified by status vectors. NB. Initially, with an empty pipeline, the status vector is 00..00
(remember status vector != collision vector)
--
what is the algorithm for generating a pipeline state diagram
-
If the shifted states vector has C_0 = 1, no new initiation is possible
if the shifted status vector has C_0 = 0, there are two possibilities
(i) initiation is not taken 
(ii) initiation is taken new status vector is the logical OR of the shifted vector and the initial collision vector
--
what is a reduced state diagram
-
a state diagram which only shows states resulting from a taken initiation
--
what is the 'greedy strategy' in pipeline design
-
always taking initiations when C_0 = 0, not always minimum average latency but usually close
--
why do we only need to consider simple cycles in pipeline design
-
it has been shown that there is always a simple cycle shorter than the complex cycles of any given pipeline
--
what are the bounds of minimum average latency
-
most X's in row <= MAL <= greedy cycle AL <= number of 1's in collision vector
--
what is the strategy for further reducing latency in a pipeline
-
add delays to reduce the chance of collision, reducing minimum average latency
