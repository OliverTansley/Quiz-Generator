--
what are the four members of flynns taxonomy
-
SISD,SIMD,MISD,MIMD
--
What is SIMD
-
single instruciton many data, a single instruction is issued by the control unit and different processing units execute it on different data
--
what is a vector computer
-
computers which contain instructions capable of being operated on an array of integers (known as vectors)
--
what is an array computer
-
computers with a large amount of sperate processing elements
--
What is MIMD
-
multiple instruciton multiple data
--
what are the two types of MIMD processors
-
shared memory and distributed memory
--
what is the advantage to distributed memory processors
-
there is no memory contention within data memory, however, the memories do need to communicate
--
what are the different interconection structures
-
shared bus,Cross bar switch matrix,static (dedicated links),multistage switching networks,CLOS networks,Cell based networks
--
what is shared bus
-
when a single bus is a shared resource between processing elements
--
what are the problems with shared bus
-
single point of failure, bus contention
--
what is a cross bar switch matrix
-
a row of processing elements is connected to a column of processing elements in a matrix configuration
--
what are the advantages to a cross bar switch matrix
-
data can be sent to multiple processing elements at once,less contention
--
what is static links
-
processing elements connected in a fixed manner, there are many possible topologies
--
what are the different topologies of staticly linked pe's
-
linear array, mesh,ring,star,hypercube,complete connection
--
what are multistaging switch networks
-
connections between processing elements that contain components which change the active connections at runtime
--
what are the two types of multistaging switch networks
-
cross-bar switch based, cell based
--
what attributes of processing element networks do we want to achieve
-
non-blocking and full access
--
what is a corss bar switch
-
a component that selects what inputs to match to what outputs with some kind of addressing logic
