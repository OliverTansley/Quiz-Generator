what are structural patterns
-
Used to ease design / implementation by identifying simple ways to realise the relationships between entities

-
a reference to a resource we only want to load on demand
--
what are the different use cases for proxies
-
delay loading (virtual proxy),protecting crutial parts of a System (protection proxy)

-
Can hide away parts of the service object, so it can be changed or controlled without client knowledge,
Allows you to manage object life cycle,
Proxy provides availability even if the service object isnâ€™t ready or available,
New proxies can be introduced without changing the service or clients
--
what are the disadvantages of proxies
-
As always - more classes get introduced, adding complexity to the code base
It adds another step in getting the response, so may result in a slower service
