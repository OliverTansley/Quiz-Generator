what are embedded systems
-
Embedded software is software integrated with physical processes. The technical problem is managing time and concurrency in computational systems.
--
what are the different measurements of dependability
-
availability,reliability,maintainability,safety,security
--
what ways do embedded systems need to be efficient
-
code size,run-time,weight,cost,energy
--
what are the different types of embedded system
-
ASIC,FPGA,DSP (digital signal processor),MPU (microprocessor unit)
--
why do we need to minimise energy consumption
-
mobile systems have restricted energy,cooling purposes,cooler temps == longer lifespan
--
what are the pros of asics
-
very fast and energy efficient, large numbers can be sold
--
what are the cons of asics
-
long design time,lack of flexibility,high initial cost
--
describe dynamic power management
-
when machines operate in different states such as idle, running and sleeping depending on thier usage
--
what are FPGAs
-
feild programmable gate arrays, are configurable hardware
--
in what ways must Embedded system memory be efficient
-
speed,energy,size,cost,volatility,persistance
--
what is scratchpad memory
-
high speed memory similar to cache except more energy efficient per access
