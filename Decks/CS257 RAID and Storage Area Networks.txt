what does RAID stand for
-
Redundant arrays of independant disks
--
what are the feaures of raid arrays
-
data stripping, Redundancy
--
what is datastriping
-
data is transparently distributed over multiple disks, they appear as one large disk.
data can be serviced in parrallel by sending multiple items of data over differnet disks, or different sections of data
over multiple disks
--
how does redundancy help our IO performance
-
used to restore disks in the event of disk failures
--
what is raid level 0
-
no redundancy is included, has best write performance as data doesnt have to be written multiple times,
any disk failure will result in a loss
--
what is raid level 1
-
mirroring, all data is stored on a separate disk. has better read performance as the disk with the lowest rotation delay can be selected. 
uses twice as much hdd storage so is expensive
--
what is raid level 2
-
redundancy through hamming codes, hamming codes are able to correct single bit errors and detect double bit errors, also requiring less
storage space.
--
what is raid level 3
-
bit interleaved parity, a disk of parity bits is stored for a set of bits in all disks, which can be used to reconstruct data when a failure occurs.
only one request can be admitted at a time so performance can suffer in high transaction environment.
--
what is raid level 4
-
strips dedicated to storing the parity bit for a select number of strips,
when a small write request is performed the differences are noted in the parity strip incurring an overhead,
when large requests are made the new parity is found by xoring the strips together
--
what is raid level 5
-
block interleaved distributed parity, parity strips are stored on different drives, has one of the best read and 'large write' performances.
--
what is raid level 6
-
dual redundancy, parity strips and reed soloman stripes are included for each set of strips to increase data loss tolerance
--
what are the advantages of SSD 
-
High-performance input/output operations per second (IOPS),Durability,Longer lifespan,Lower power consumption,Quieter and cooler running capabilities,Lower access times and latency rates
--
what are the benefits of storage area networks
-
centralised storage management,operational flexibility,storage pooling - higher utilisation
--
what are the different kinds of failures that can occur
-
disk drive failure, power supply or fan failure,storage controller failure,System unit failures,interface failures
--
what is a flash copy and how can they be implemented
-
produces an instant copy of data while application is running, copy on write algorithm
--
what are the two kids of remote copy
-
synchronous: data is copied before completing host write instruction,
asynchronous: data is copied after completing host write instruction
