--
why do we represent Knowledge 
-
human/intelligent thinking is conditioned on Knowledge
--
what is a proposition
-
a statement which is either true or false
--
what are the components of a definitive clause
-
the body, a logical formula, and the head, a variable which stores the result of the logical formula
--
what is an expert system
-
a system that performs inference using a Knowledge base
--
How does the MYCIN system work
-
patient data and expert data are used to build the Knowledge base, a consultation program performs a tree search to determine a diagnosis from the kb
--
what are formal systems comprised of
-
an alphabet, axioms, grammer (manipulations)
--
what are alphabets replaced by in Knowledge expression
-
a vocabulary that consists of, objects in the domain, attributes for each object, values for each attribute
--
what is working Memory
-
a store of facts and propositions, described using the vocabulary and grammer of the system
--
what is the structure of a production rule
-
antecedent: conditions to execute the rule, consequent: the changes made when executing the rule
--
what are the two types of inference control
-
Global control:domain independant control,Local control: domain specific control
--
what are the set of rules fired in a kb known as
-
an inference chain
--
what is the result of an inference chain
-
a logical proof/solution
--
what are the two types of chaining
-
Forward chaining:facts continue to be infered even if unrelated to the goal,Backward chaining: data is only used if it is related to the goal
--
what is an askable clause
-
when our kb doesnt contain needed information we can ask the user to provide it
--
what are the four types of non syntactic errors in kb
-
An incorrect answer is produced,An answer was not produced ,infinite loop,system asks irrelevant questions
--
what is conflict resolution
-
the method for choosing which rule should be fired, given multiple available rules
--
what are different conflict resolution approaches
-
fire rules in order they arrive, fire the most specific rule,only allow a rule to fire once on the same data (preventing loops in inference), use of meta knowledge
--
what is meta knowledge
-
knowledge about knowledge
--
what is the RETE algorithm
-
construction of a network of antecedents to more efficiently determine what rules can be fired, a token is passed through the network, and a corresponding rule is fired, the network is then updated
with any new antecedents, and the conflict set is updated from the previous iteration
--
what are some pros of rule based systems
-
Easy mapping between expert knowledge and format of rules,Each rule represents one piece of knowledge,Separation of knowledge from the processing/control structures,Ability to represent and reason with uncertain knowledge,Exhaustive search through all rules during each inference cycle
--
what is the con of rule based systems
-
The Knowledge Acquisition Bottleneck: System does no independent learning
--
what are the two methods of assumption based learning
-
Abduction - An agent makes assumptions to explain observations,
Default Reasoning - An agent makes assumptions of normality to make predictions,
