what are the two types of inference control
-
Global control:domain independant control,Local control: domain specific control
--
what are the set of rules fired in a kb known as
-
an inference chain
--
what is the result of an inference chain
-
a logical proof/solution
--
what are the two types of chaining
-
Forward chaining:facts continue to be infered even if unrelated to the goal,Backward chaining: data is only used if it is related to the goal
--
what is an askable clause
-
when our kb doesnt contain needed information we can ask the user to provide it
