Define Superscalar processing
-
Fetching and decoding more than one instruction at a time
--
what is the window in a Superscalar processor
-
a simple staging register between the fetching and decoding pipelines and the execution pipelines
--
what is the degree of a Superscalar Processor
-
The number of replications before the window
--
what is a non-uniform Superscalar processor
-
a Superscalar processor, where stages following the window are not replications of the base pipeline
--
what is a super-pipelined processor
-
where internal clocks run at twice the speed allowing 2 instructions to be fetched within one clock cycle
