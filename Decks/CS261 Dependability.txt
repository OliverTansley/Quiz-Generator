what is Dependability
-
The trustworthiness of a computer system such that reliance can justifiably be placed in the service it delivers
--
why is Dependability important
-
System Failures affect people,Users reject unreliable systems,System failures are costly,Undependable systems cause information loss
--
how can we measure reliability
-
Probability of Failure on Demand,Rate of occurrence of failures,Mean time to failure,Availability
--
what are the different attributes of Dependability
-
Availability - The likeliness that a service provided by a computer system is
ready for use,
Reliability - A measure of how likely the system is to provide its service,
Safety - The extent to which a system can operate without damaging its environment,
Confidentiality and Integrity of data,
Maintainability - Defined as a function of time representing the probability that
a failed computer system will be repaired in t time or less,
--
what attributes are related to Dependability
-
Repairability , Maintainability , Error Tolerance 
--
what is a fault
-
the cause of an error
--
what is an error
-
the manifestation of a fault
--
what is a failure
-
the result of an error propagating beyond a system boundry
--
what are the three kinds of system failures
-
harware failure,Software failure,operational failure
--
how can we provide Dependability to our systems
-
fault avoidance (careful Development), fault detection and correction (find and remove faults before deployment), fault Tolerance (design a system that is capable of dealing with faults)
--
what are the different ways a system could recover from an error
-
graceful degradation: system operates in reduced capacity
Redundancy: spare capacity is included that can be used if other parts failed
Diversity: redundant components are unique so less likely to have same failures
--
what is a dependable Processor
-
steps which ensure that dependable Software is produced
--
what are the features of dependable processes
-
Documentable , Standardised , Auditable , Diverse , Robust 
--
what are the different kinds of dependable system architecture
-
protection systems,Self-monitoring architectures,N-version Programming
--
how do protection systems work
-
they are a seperate system that runs in parallel with the original system, performs an action in the case of a fault
--
how do self monitoring systems work
-
monitors the environment all the time computing the same outputs as the original system in a more diverse way, if a difference is detected an action is performed
--
how does N version programming work 
-
multiple copies of a system are made by different development teams, the outputs of each are compared and the majority vote is chosen
--
what feature do dependable systems rely on
-
diversity - to reduce the chance of multiple systems failing in the same way
